# JvisionDecoderToInfluxdb
Jvision OpenConfig decoder to InfluxDB writer Interfaced with Grafana as Analytics Collector

##Why is Data Analytics important?
Data analytics helps organizations harness their data and use it to identify new opportunities. That, in turn, leads to smarter business moves, more efficient operations, higher profits and happier customers. Good analysis tells this story with actionable results (both short and long-term) to improve performance and drive business forward. Not only should it provide insights and optimizations based on historical findings, but it should also use trends to predict what will happen in the future.

Network Data analytics plays an important role in many areas of networking management, like, performance tuning, server load balancing, predicting buffer requirements, setting up crach backup threshold, monitoring traffic for anomalous patterns, etc.

QFX10008 switches form a highly scalable, high-density network foundation for supporting todayâ€™s most demanding data center and cloud environments. The switch provides analytical insight into L2 and L3 statistics of real time traffic. This information is used for performance tuning of the network.

This project aims to visualize network telemetry metrics of QFX10008 using open source components. The framework is made easy to understand and modify.

Juniper Telemetry Interface(JTI) can send network metrics by CLI(Command Line Interface) method or by Programmatic method (gRPC - general Remote Procedure Calling). For this project we are concentrating on CLI method of collecting network metrics.

##Getting Started
QFX servers run a GRPC(General Remote Procedure Calling)-server program that collects metrics and forwards it to its subscribed GRPC-clients.

GRPC-server are configured to communicate by a global standard protocol called GPB(Google protocol buffer) that defines communication in OpenConfig format.

##JvisionDecoder
JvisionDecoder is application that collects streaming data from QFX-switches and serializes structured data, then writes the collected data into a log file on the port number being listened to.

Ex: jvision_port_2000.txt, jvision_port_3002.txt, jvision_port_9000.txt

#JvsionDecoderToInfluxdb.py
In order to visualize JvisionDecoder logs on a graph metrics. The framework used is Grafana-InfluxDB. Grafana is a Metrics, Analytics, dashboards and monitoring tool, when this is used along with Influx Database(Time-series data storage) we can display a live monitoring tool for Jvision-QFX.

JvsionDecoderToInfluxdb.py script writes Openconfig Jvision logs to InfluxDatabase serially. The script uses a follow code to check new changes to the log file and dumps it into database, which gives user a real time analysis output. (The script is made to read one line above the current line to eliminate any incomplete log line).

### Installing
All commands are used on  DEB (Ubuntu / Debian 64bit) OS. If you are using a different system, please go to Grafana and InfluxDB homepage and follow the instructions for specific environment.

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

Python2.7 (Skip if already installed)
```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall
$ sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev
```
Then download using the following command:
```
cd ~/Downloads/
wget http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/Python-2.7.5.tgz
```
Extract and go to the dirctory:
```
tar -xvf Python-2.7.5.tgz
cd Python-2.7.5
```
Now, install using the command you just tried:
```
./configure
make
sudo checkinstall
```

Grafana
```
$ wget https://grafanarel.s3.amazonaws.com/builds/grafana_3.1.1-1470047149_amd64.deb
$ sudo apt-get install -y adduser libfontconfig
$ sudo dpkg -i grafana_3.1.1-1470047149_amd64.deb
```

InfluxDB
```
$ wget https://dl.influxdata.com/influxdb/releases/influxdb_0.13.0_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i influxdb_0.13.0_amd64.deb
```

Kapacitor (Optional)

For Time-Series Data Processing, Alerting and Anomaly Detection install Kapacitor which can be interfaced with Slack Messenger app to get info, warnings and critical updates via channel stream broadcasting.

```
$ wget https://dl.influxdata.com/kapacitor/releases/kapacitor_0.13.1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i kapacitor_0.13.1_amd64.deb
```

###Prerequisites
After Installing Grafana, InfluxDB and Kapacitor. Follow these steps to connect each of the application to form a framework.

1. Start InfluxDB-server. Open a web browser and access web interface for InfluxDB http://127.0.0.1:8083. Create a database in InfluxDB and call it "jvision". Query: CREATE DATABASE "jvision"
```
$ sudo service influxdb start
```

2. Start Grafana-server. Open a web browser and access web interface for InfluxDB http://127.0.0.1:3000. Login to Grafana: admin/admin. Goto Grafana web interface and add a datasource linked to influxdb "jvision" on port 8086. i.e https://127.0.0.1:8086 with database: jvision, User: root, Password: root
```
$ sudo service grafana-server start
```

3. (Optional) Start Kapacitor. and follow below instructions.
Run the following command to create a default configuration file:
```
kapacitord config > kapacitor.conf
```
Edit kapacitor.conf and uncomment slack configuration and add new incoming web hook.

Send the alert to Slack. To allow Kapacitor to post to Slack, go to the URL https://slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook and create a new incoming webhook and place the generated URL in the 'slack' configuration section. Example:

```
[slack]
  enabled = true
    url = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    channel = "#general"
```

include jvision.tick script(source code in the repo) and run kapacitor with the config file.
```
kapacitord -config kapacitor.conf
```

Configure kapacitor with jvision.tick script: (jvision_now is kapacitor instance )
```
$ kapacitor define -name jvision_now -type stream -tick jvision.tick -dbrp jvision.awesome_policy
$ kapacitor enable jvision_now
$ kapacitor show jvision_now
```

Install Slack(https://slack.com/downloads) and login to the channel to receive messages.

## Running the script

###Grafana
Create graphs on Grafana to query into InfluxDB.

Set refresh time policy to '5s' and zoom into the required graph for better visualization.
Add in multiple graphs and queries for multi-visualization.

Adding graphs in Grafana: http://docs.grafana.org/guides/gettingstarted/

###InfluxDB
Goto InfluxDB web interface: https://127.0.0.1:8083. 

Select database jvision and Query:

```
SHOW MEASUREMENTS - Display list of servers
SELECT * FROM <MEASUREMENT> - Display all key-value pair of <MEASUREMENT> server
SHOW FIELD KEYS - Display only field keys
SHOW TAG KEYS - Display only tag keys

Ex queries:
select rx_bps FROM "valinch02_qfx10008_01" where "interface"='xe-1/0/33:3' and "component_id"='1'
select rx_pps from valinch02_qfx10008_01 where "interface"='et-1/0/22'
```

![Alt text](/results/InfluxDB.PNG?raw=true "InfluxDB")

###Kapacitor
Edit jvision.tick to set required boundaries to monitor parameters and alert when the conditions does not meet the requirements. For example when the normal operation of the server is stalled or slows down below a normal operating range like. if tx_pps < 850000 warn message.

Note: Kapacitor uses TICK script. Use "lambda:" formulae to add watch algorithms to monitor and report info depending on the algorithm.

TICK script lambda expressions: https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v0.13/tick/expr/
